# Adaptive

Please DO NOT make changes in the already existing (given) files. Make a new independent branch and a new m files and start working on those. We can in the end merge all of it togather. Tracking changes in the already existing files could be difficult as everyone of us would have different versions. 


This avoids a lot of headache later.
